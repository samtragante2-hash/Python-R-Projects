# Python-R-Projects

Welcome to my Data Analytics & Optimization Projects Repository! ðŸ‘‹

Here youâ€™ll find a collection of my Python and R scripts showcasing projects that combine data analysis, machine learning, optimization modeling, and automation. Each folder is organized by project, with clear documentation and comments explaining the purpose, logic, and outcomes of the scripts.

If youâ€™re a potential employer or collaborator, I invite you to explore the R section for statistical modeling, linear programming, and data visualization, and the Python section for data engineering, predictive analytics, and workflow automation examples. Every project reflects my passion for turning data into actionable insights and demonstrates the technical precision and problem-solving skills I bring to real-world challenges.
